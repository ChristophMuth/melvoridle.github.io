==NEW SKILLS: FISHING & FIREMAKING==
This update introduces two new skills, Fishing & Firemaking!

FISHING
- Cast your rod into the vast lakes and oceans to discover difference species of fish to acquire! A very peaceful skill to be expanded upon in the future.

FIREMAKING
- Burn the logs acquired from Woodcutting to acquire experience. Watch your potential GP earnings light up in flames right before your eyes. A worthy sacrifice if I say so myself.
- Increase your XP potential by upgrading your bonfire. Nothing better than lighting fires on top of more fires!

==NEW BANK UI==
I have redesign the bank to better suit the design of the game. Selecting the bank now brings up all items you have, and also provides the potential to upgrade as well.

Bank upgrades are now also additive. Maximum bank capacity currently set at 7,000. Your current bank upgrades will update accordingly with this update.

==NEW SHOP UI==
The shop for each skills looks a bit different. This is to correlate with the new bank UI to keep it similar. Please let me know what you think.

==OTHER CHANGES==
- GP values have been updated and now display in a similar form to Runescape. Hover over your GP to view the exact amount.
- Base Woodcutting interval has been increased from 2000 to 3000.
- Removed the ability to disabled Auto Save.

==CONTENT UPDATE: WOODCUTTING PRESTIGE==
This update includes the implementation of Woodcutting Prestige. Achieving Skill Mastery not enough?
Continue into prestige ranks and achieve levels far beyond originally possible.
		
- Entering Woodcutting Prestige allows you to level passed Level 99.
- All Woodcutting XP Rates are multiplied by 10.
- Logs are worth much more GP.

Once you prestige, you will be required to unlock the higher level trees again through leveling. Woodcutting becomes quite
profitable later on if you make it that far.
				
Woodcutting Prestige is optional. However, once you prestige there is no way of returning. Decide wisely!

==Birds Nests==
- Added the chance of receiving a "Birds Nest" from a tree when cut. These nests have a 1 in 250 chance
of being acquired. They provide an instant GP increase of 20 times that of the tree you got it from.
- These become quite valuable in Woodcutting Prestige.
- Bird nests will be a feature expanded upon in the future.

==Woodcutting Statistics==
- Added some small statistics for those who like to keep track of numbers. Unfortunately this does 
not include your stats prior to Alpha v0.02.

==Changes to Woodcutting Random Events==
- Previously, a random event would cause all cut buttons to be disabled until the event finished. 
Throughout testing, I believe this is an unfair and frustrating disadvantage to the player, especially
if they do not wish to participate in the event.
- All cut buttons are now enabled during random events.
- You are also able to Auto Cut the random event.

==Tree XP/GP Balancing==
The amount of XP and GP earned from trees later on in the game has been reduced.
(In order of tree based on level)

Old XP Rates - [10,20,30,50,80,120,200,320,500]
New XP Rates - [10,20,30,50,80,100,140,180,250]

Old GP Rates - [1,5,10,20,40,100,250,500,1000]
New GP Rates - [1,5,10,20,40,80,125,200,275]

==An Update on Trees Becoming Useless==
Just thought I'd address this issue. Common feedback received showed a dislike for trees becoming redundant
as you level up. I completely agree with this feedback, and have thought about how I can make better use
of these redundant trees.

I have decided to leave it as is for now until the introduction of Firemaking. This skill will require
logs as the main source to level it up. Hopefully this will provide a use for the redundant trees when released.
Upon release of this skill, I will gather feedback to see if this is a suitable trade-off.

As the game progresses, more and more skills will be added to the game. If you follow RuneScape at all, you
are probably farmiliar with what new skills will eventually be introduced, and how they all interact with
one-another.

==SKILLS PREVIEW: FISHING & FIREMAKING==
This update includes a preview for the two upcoming skills, Fishing & Firemaking. The preview is designed to ahoq
what the new skills will consist of, and provide an insight into a new mechanic.

Fishing: Self explanatory. Select a location to catch the designated fish assigned to that area to level up.
Firemaking: Burn the logs collected from Woodcutting to level up the skill. This skill introduces a bonfire
mechanic to reward consistent gameplay. More information to come...

Along with this preview you can see there has been a UI change to cater for the new skills.

Fishing & Firemaking is due for release in Alpha v0.03.

==OTHER CHANGES:==
- Your save game now automatically loads, rather than requiring you to press the "Load Game" button.
- Moved position of "GP" & "Bank" to top of screen. This is due to the upcoming skill released planned for the future.
- Removed the image for you current axe. This information is now displayed above your experience bar.
- Added the axe images to the "Shop".
- Updated "Insufficient Level" badges for axes in the shop to display the level requirement instead.
- Reduced Level Requirement for 3rd Age Axe to Level 90 (Down from Level 95)

Alpha v0.01

23rd November 2018

Welcome the the initial release of Melvor Idle. This is an ever-expanding "idle" game, 
based on the popular MMORPG "Runescape", where the aim is to level up your skills and 
reach skill mastery along the way.

FIRST SKILL RELEASE: WOODCUTTING
- Explore the vast landscape, where you will discover 9 different species of trees 
awaiting the fury of your axe. Cut down trees with a selection of 9 powerful axes, 
and earn GP to master the skill of Woodcutting.

Auto Cutting
- Tired of clicking? Lazy? Just let the game do it for you. However, you need to 
earn that ability via Milestones.

Random Events
- There is a 1 in 100 chance of a random event taking place when a tree is cut. These 
random events last for 20 seconds, and provide various benefits if you chose to participate. 
These benefits include:
	- Double XP
	- Double Logs acquired from a fallen tree
	- Faster Cutting

- Random events are optional, however some actions are disabled during the duration of 
the event. It's up to you to decide what to do.

Autosave
- This game includes an autosave feature, so you don't have to worry about losing your 
progress! After every action, your progress will save. You may disabled the autosave 
feature if you wish.

The Future
- This game will be updated on a consistent basis, with new features added with every 
new version. The vision for this game is quite large in scale, hoping to provide the 
player with a sense of reward for leveling up skills. Alpha v0.02 is already almost 
complete in terms of features. Check back next week to see what has been added/changed!
