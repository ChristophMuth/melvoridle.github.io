Alpha v0.01

23rd November 2018

Welcome the the initial release of Melvor Idle. This is an ever-expanding "idle" game, 
based on the popular MMORPG "Runescape", where the aim is to level up your skills and 
reach skill mastery along the way.

FIRST SKILL RELEASE: WOODCUTTING
- Explore the vast landscape, where you will discover 9 different species of trees 
awaiting the fury of your axe. Cut down trees with a selection of 9 powerful axes, 
and earn GP to master the skill of Woodcutting.

Auto Cutting
- Tired of clicking? Lazy? Just let the game do it for you. However, you need to 
earn that ability via Milestones.

Random Events
- There is a 1 in 100 chance of a random event taking place when a tree is cut. These 
random events last for 20 seconds, and provide various benefits if you chose to participate. 
These benefits include:
	- Double XP
	- Double Logs acquired from a fallen tree
	- Faster Cutting

- Random events are optional, however some actions are disabled during the duration of 
the event. It's up to you to decide what to do.

Autosave
- This game includes an autosave feature, so you don't have to worry about losing your 
progress! After every action, your progress will save. You may disabled the autosave 
feature if you wish.

The Future
- This game will be updated on a consistent basis, with new features added with every 
new version. The vision for this game is quite large in scale, hoping to provide the 
player with a sense of reward for leveling up skills. Alpha v0.02 is already almost 
complete in terms of features. Check back next week to see what has been added/changed!
